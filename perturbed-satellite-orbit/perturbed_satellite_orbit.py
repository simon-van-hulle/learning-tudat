## Environment setup
"""
Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.
"""


### Create the bodies
"""
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refere to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

Finally, the system of bodies is created using the settings. This system of bodies is stored into the variable `bodies`.
"""

# Define string names for bodies to be created from default.
bodies_to_create = ["Sun", "Earth", "Moon", "Mars", "Venus"]

# Use "Earth"/"J2000" as global frame origin and orientation.
global_frame_origin = "Earth"
global_frame_orientation = "J2000"

# Create default body settings, usually from `spice`.
body_settings = environment_setup.get_default_body_settings(
    bodies_to_create, global_frame_origin, global_frame_orientation
)

# Create system of selected celestial bodies
bodies = environment_setup.create_system_of_bodies(body_settings)


### Create the vehicle
"""
Let's now create the 400kg satellite for which the perturbed orbit around Earth will be propagated.

bodies.get("Delfi-C3").mass = 400.0


# To account for the aerodynamic of the satellite, let's add an aerodynamic interface and add it to the environment setup, taking the followings into account:
# - A constant drag coefficient of 1.2.
# - A reference area of 4m$^2$.
# - No sideslip or lift coefficient (equal to 0).
# - No moment coefficient.

# To account for the pressure of the solar radiation on the satellite, let's add another interface. This takes a radiation pressure coefficient of 1.2, and a radiation area of 4m$^2$. This interface also accounts for the variation in pressure cause by the shadow of Earth.

# Create radiation pressure settings, and add to vehicle
reference_area_radiation = 4.0

radiation_pressure_settings = environment_setup.radiation_pressure.cannonball(
    "Sun", reference_area_radiation, radiation_pressure_coefficient, occulting_bodies

environment_setup.add_radiation_pressure_interface(bodies, "Delfi-C3", radiation_pressure_settings)


## Propagation setup
"""
Now that the environment is created, the propagation setup is defined.

First, the bodies to be propagated and the central bodies will be defined.
Central bodies are the bodies with respect to which the state of the respective propagated bodies is defined.

central_bodies = ["Earth"]


### Create the acceleration model
"""
First off, the acceleration settings that act on `Delfi-C3` are to be defined.
In this case, these consist in the followings:
- Graviational acceleration of Earth modeled as Spherical Harmonics, taken up to a degree and order 5.
- Gravitational acceleration of the Sun, the Moon, Mars, and Venus, modeled as a Point Mass.
- Aerodynamic acceleration caused by the atmosphere of the Earth (using the aerodynamic interface defined earlier).
- Radiation pressure acceleration caused by the Sun (using the radiation interface defined earlier).

The acceleration settings defined are then applied to `Delfi-C3` in a dictionary.

This dictionary is finally input to the propagation setup to create the acceleration models.

### Define the initial state
"""
The initial state of the vehicle that will be propagated is now defined. 

This initial state always has to be provided as a cartesian state, in the form of a list with the first three elements reprensenting the initial position, and the three remaining elements representing the initial velocity.

In this case, let's make use of the `keplerian_to_cartesian_elementwise()` function that is included in the `element_conversion` module, so that the initial state can be input as Keplerian elements, and then converted in Cartesian elements.
"""

# propagated in this simulation. The initial conditions are given in
# Keplerian elements and later on converted to Cartesian elements

### Define dependent variables to save
"""
In this example, we are interested in saving not only the propagated state of the satellite over time, but also a set of so-called dependent variables, that are to be computed (or extracted and saved) at each integration step.

[This page](https://tudatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependent_variable.html) of the tudatpy API website provides a detailled explanation of all the dependent variables that are available.

### Create the propagator settings
"""
The propagator is finally setup.

First, a termination condition is defined so that the propagation will stop when the end epochs that was defined is reached.

Subsequently, the integrator settings are defined using a RK4 integrator with the fixed step size of 10 seconds.

Then, the translational propagator settings are defined. These are used to simulate the orbit of `Delfi-C3` around Earth.

## Propagate the orbit
"""
The orbit is now ready to be propagated.

This is done by calling the `create_dynamics_simulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation` module.
This function requires the `bodies` and `propagator_settings` that have all been defined earlier.

After this, the history of the propagated state over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history, taking the form of a dictionary, is then converted to an array containing 7 columns:
- Column 0: Time history, in seconds since J2000.
- Columns 1 to 3: Position history, in meters, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.
- Columns 4 to 6: Velocity history, in meters per second, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.

The same is done with the dependent variable history. The column indexes corresponding to a given dependent variable in
the `dep_vars` variable are printed when the simulation is run, when `create_dynamics_simulator()` is called.
Do mind that converting to an ndarray using the `result2array()` utility will shift these indexes, since the first column (index 0) will then be the times.
